# Google Drive shareable url to direct download

gdirect is a simple command line tool which will generate direct download Google Drive urls from your shareable urls.

## Installation:

```
npm install gdirect -g
```

## Usage

```
gdirect https://drive.google.com/file/d/XYZ/view?usp=sharing
```

**Note:** the script is very basic and does nothing fancy, just a quick replace but is helpful if you are dealing with direct downloads all the time. If you want to parse additional urls, please make a pull request :)
